## 859. Buddy Strings

### Question
Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

* For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

```
Example 1:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

Example 2:

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.

Example 3:

Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.


```
Constraints:

* 1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104
* s and goal consist of lowercase letters.

### Solution:
    ``` Python
        class Solution(object):
            def buddyStrings(self, s, goal):
                """
                :type s: str
                :type goal: str
                :rtype: bool
                """
        
                i,j,x = -1,-1,0

                if len(s) != len(goal):
                    return False

                if s == goal :
                    frequency = [0]*26
                    for ch in s:
                        frequency[ord(ch)-ord('a')] += 1
                        if frequency[ord(ch)-ord('a')] == 2:
                            return True
                    return False

                while x<len(goal):
                    if s[x] != goal[x]:
                        if i == -1:
                        i = x
                        elif j == -1:
                            j = x
                        else:
                            return False
                    x+=1
        
                return s[i] == goal[j] and s[j] == goal[i]

    ```
